Various documentation and test apps for sending logs to Graylog via syslog.

Note that in most situations it would be preferable to send logs to Graylog as [Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)](https://docs.graylog.org/en/4.1/pages/sending/gelf.html) messages; this repository is only when the logs must be sent through syslog.
